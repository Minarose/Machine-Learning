# Deep Learning for Neuroimaging
In this repository is code for the design of convolutional autoencoders to reconstruct neuroimaging signals from resting-state EEG and fMRI. 
*The following code was used as a part of my undergraduate thesis and research practicum project under the supervision of Dr. Kiret Dhindsa, Dr. Jason Bernard, and Dr. Ranil Sonnadara at the Performance Science Lab at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.*
